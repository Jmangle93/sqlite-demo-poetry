# SQLite Demo with Poetry
This project was made for two primary learning objectives in line with parts of two Pluralsight courses: 
- SQLite with Python, simple database management
- Poetry for Python dependency management and packaging

It's a simple set of functions that fetch cryptocurrency prices and allow you to add investments from/to a SQLite database.
SQLite, because I'm new to SQL/database management in general and it doesn't require a server. Poetry is overkill for such a small project, but it seems great for robust application development and I want to learn it.
